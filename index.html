              <span class="colour1">Sorting is when one puts things in a specific order that is known to us, be it in alphabetical order or numeric order.
              Sorting is incredibly useful for computers because just like in life, if computers know how files, games or student names
              on a list are ordered then it makes finding and working with all of these values a lot easier.</span>
              <br><br>
              <span class="colour2">Oftentimes you need to choose the correct sorting method for the correct moment. Imagine we took your house and put all the blue items in your
              bedroom and all the red ones in the kitchen.
              Whilst you may know where items are, it isn't very useful to sort out items like this as it will still make getting them a bit of a challenge.</span>
              <br><br>
              <span class="colour3">When it comes to computers, sometimes we work with a lot of information, and if you sort the information using the wrong method, it would firstly take a long time and secondly you wouldn't be able to find what you need easily.
              This lesson will be teaching one of the fastest and easiest to understand sorting methods in order to make sure you sort your information quickly
              as well as find it quickly.</span>
              <br><br>
              <span class="colour4">Selection sort is a method of sorting whereby step by step we compare two values from the beginning of an unsorted list to try to find the smallest value.
              Once this is found it gets put at the beginning of the list and this process is repeated for the rest of the values until there are no more values to sort.</span>
